      <h3>Current project: Noder</h3>
      <p>My current project that I am working on is Noder. it is a blog that
      I created. The purpose of the blog is teach more about Node.js and
      have more dicussion on Programming and Javascript. At the very moment
      The website is still being develope, but the website is up. So if anyone
      want to view it, there will be a link</p>

      <p>One of the things I am currently working on is a database, I think
      about using MySql instead of mongo, and my reason for that is MySql is
      widely use, so as a noob developer I think I should use MySql so I can
      learn Sql. Another reason for MySql is the cost of having a server
      running MySql. MySql is run on a lot of places, and it super cheap
      compare to other like mangoDB.</p>
