      <h2>P5.js is Amazing!!!!!</h2>
      <h3>6-7-2016</h3>
      <article>
        I built a drawing app out of P5.js. P5.js is a really is great
        javascript library I recommend it for any HTML5 canvas project.
        I really had fun making the drawing app, the app is call "drawz!"
        it's a weird name. PersonallyI like to put 'Z' instead of 'S',
        because it looks cooler.
        <br>
        A little history lesson on P5.js. P5.js is made by the people that made
        processing. Processing is a ide for making art in code or algorithms.
        The people that made processing, were like javascript is awesome. And
        they made p5.js. The drawing app was made around a specific mechanic
        in the p5.js library. That was drawing on the canvas freely. This
        idea has been lingering in my head for quit a while now, finally I made.
        Now I really want to make a this app into a mobile phone app for android.
        So I have work to do. Here a link to p5.js if you want to know.

      <h2>Why I like to program</h2>
      <h3>5-29-2016</h3>
      <article>
        My current and main project is this website. This website is a
        personal website. I am just now getting into github. I have a few projects
        on my account most of the projects is base around math, that because the only
        class that really aloud me to make a computer program is math. Later on I will get
         in to the details about those projects. Generally I like computer programming
         , computer programming is so fun and mind blowing. For me computer programming
         is like feeding a god machine instruction on how to create something. Even
         though computer programming is very hard, it's also very fun. One of the skills
        programming has taught me is to learn. To teach myself new things and exciting things
        to myself. That is why I like to program.
